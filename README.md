# Twitter sentiment by topic :
This project aims to create a model to do sentiment classification of tweets. We get a dataset of tweets and preprocess it. We then use the pretrained BERT model then fine tune it on sentiment classification. We finally create an app using the obtained model and deploy it using streamlit.
