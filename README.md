# Twitter sentiment by topic :
This project aims to create a model to analyze the sentiment of dataset of tweets by topic. We get the dataset and preprocess it. We then use the pretrained BERT model then fine tune it on sentiment classification. We finally create an app using the fine tuned model and deploy it using streamlit.
