# Twitter sentiment by topic :
This project aims to create a model to analyze the sentiment of dataset of tweets by topic. We get the dataset and preprocess it. We then
use the pretrained BERT model then fine tune it on sentiment classification.  
An application was created to use the model to analyze the sentiment of tweets regarding a topic. The app is deployed using streamlit.
